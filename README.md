# Academic Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for eight different machine learning problems solved during my academic coursework. Below is a brief description of each problem.

---

## **Problem 1**: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Performed clustering using KMeans, KMeans++, and DBSCAN on `digitData2.csv`.
- Applied PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction on the diabetes dataset.
- Compared performance across algorithms and techniques.

## **Problem 2**: Regression, Classification, and PCA
- Trained linear and logistic regression models on housing, iris, and digits datasets.
- Applied PCA and analyzed its impact on model performance.
- Built SVM models with RBF and polynomial kernels for diabetes classification.

## **Problem 3**: Classification with KNN and Decision Trees
- Built KNN and Decision Tree models for digit classification.
- Explored different distance metrics (cityblock, cosine) for KNN.
- Implemented Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for HR attrition prediction.

## **Problem 4**: MLP for MNIST
- Designed an MLP model with 16 hidden layers for digit classification using `mnist_784`.
- Improved performance with hyperparameter tuning.

## **Problem 5**: PCA and Obesity Prediction
- Applied PCA to analyze dimensionality reduction on `SCADI.csv`.
- Built a regression model for predicting obesity levels using `obesity_levels.csv`.

## **Problem 6**: Yeast Dataset Classification
- Analyzed feature importance for protein prediction.
- Built and optimized supervised learning models for classification.

## **Problem 7**: Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering
- Applied UMAP for dimensionality reduction on `tripadvisor_review.csv`.
- Explored DBSCAN and advanced clustering methods.
- Built ensemble models for yeast dataset classification.

## **Problem 8**: Intrusion Detection
- Reproduced results for various classification methods (SVM, KNN, Decision Trees) on the `NSL-KDD` dataset.
- Followed experiment protocols to match published results.
